# Super-Soukoban

## Presentation

This project is a game analysis of the game **_Super Soukoban_**, developed by Thinking Rabbit and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1993. The team is composed by two students of CITM Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain).

## Description
Super Soukoban is a captivating puzzle game where players take on the role of a warehouse worker. Their mission? To skillfully maneuver crates through intricate mazes, ensuring they reach their designated storage spots. The challenge lies in avoiding accidental crate entrapment, as once a box is pushed into an unreachable position, it becomes irretrievable.

Developed by Thinking Rabbit, this game follows the blueprint set by the original Sokoban, which debuted on home computers in 1982. In this SNES adaptation, players face an additional twist: each stage imposes a fixed move limit. Thus, not only must they arrange the boxes correctly, but they must do so with maximum efficiency.

While Super Soukoban remains a hidden gem, it unfortunately never ventured beyond the borders of Japan.
